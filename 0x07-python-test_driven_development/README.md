# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This project involves writing functions and creating tests for them using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## Function: `add_integer()`
- This function adds two integers or floats.
- Floats are cast to integers before addition.
- Raises a `TypeError` if the inputs are not integers or floats.
