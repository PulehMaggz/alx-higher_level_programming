# 0x11-python-network_1

This project is part of the **ALX Higher Level Programming** curriculum. It focuses on Python scripts that interact with web resources using the `urllib` library and other networking-related concepts.

---

## Task: Fetch https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status

This project includes a Python script (`0-hbtn_status.py`) that fetches the URL `https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status` and displays the body of the response in a specific format.

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files end with a new line.
- The first line of all scripts is `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code follows the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.8.*).
- Scripts use `with` statements for resource management.
- Use `urllib` only; no other external libraries are allowed.

### Example Output
Running the script:
```bash
./0-hbtn_status.py
