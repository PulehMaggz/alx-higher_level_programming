# Import and Add

This project includes a Python script (`0-add.py`) that imports a function from another file (`add_0.py`) and prints the result of an addition.

## Usage:
Ensure both `0-add.py` and `add_0.py` are in the same directory, then run:

```bash
./0-add.py

# Argument Counter

This project includes a Python script (`2-args.py`) that prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists them with their positions.

## Usage:
Run the script from the command line and pass any number of arguments:

```bash
./2-args.py arg1 arg2 arg3
