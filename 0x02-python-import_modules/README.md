# Python - Import & Modules

This project demonstrates how to use import and modules in Python by implementing a simple addition function.

## Files

- `add_0.py`: Contains the addition function `add(a, b)`.
- `0-add.py`: Imports the `add` function and performs the addition of 1 + 2.

# Argument Counter

This project includes a Python script (`2-args.py`) that prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists them with their positions.

## Usage:
Run the script from the command line and pass any number of arguments:

```bash
./2-args.py arg1 arg2 arg3
