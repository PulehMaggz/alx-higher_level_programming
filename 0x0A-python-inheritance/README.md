# Python Inheritance - Lookup Function

## Description

This project implements a function `lookup()` that returns the list of all attributes
and methods of an object. This is a basic exercise to learn about Python's class inheritance
and how to interact with an object's methods and attributes.

## Usage

To use the `lookup()` function, simply pass an object to it, and it will return a list
containing the names of all the attributes and methods.

## Example

```python
class MyClass():
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(lookup(obj))
