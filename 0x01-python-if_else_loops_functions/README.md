- Code must adhere to PEP 8 style guide (pycodestyle).

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./2-print_alphabet.py

### Additional Steps

1. **Create and Save Files**:
   - Save the Python script as `2-print_alphabet.py`.
   - Save the README content as `README.md`.

2. **Make the Python Script Executable**:
